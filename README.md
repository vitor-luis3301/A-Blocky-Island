# WHAT THE HELL IS "A BLOCKY ISLAND"
A Blocky Island (maybe i'll think about a better name in the future) is a game made in the Unity game engine.
It uses 2d graphics and sprites in a 3d environment with orthographic view to make it look like a Zelda NES game, with the twist that you can JUMP!

As you can see it's not finished
i'll keep updating this as it goes
In the meantime you can download some of the demos I'll be releasing
They'll test different parts of the game

Think of this project as a mix with Minecraft and Terraria with Zelda-like gameplay and a whole bunch more. 

STUFF THAT I WILL ADD
1. Procedural world generation ❌
2. Building system ❌
3. Crafting recepies ❌
4. More movement mechanics ❌
